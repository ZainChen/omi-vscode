<h2 align="center">Omi - Next generation web framework using web components with omio fallback(IE8+) in tiny js.</h2>

## Why Omi?

- Tiny size
- Supports TypeScript
- Reactive data-binding
- Having official UI components - [omiu](https://tencent.github.io/omi/packages/omiu/examples/build/index.html)
- Excellent compatibility(IE8+) with [omio](https://github.com/Tencent/omi/tree/master/packages/omio)
- Real [MVVM](https://github.com/Tencent/omi/blob/master/tutorial/omi-mvvm.md) with [mappingjs](https://github.com/Tencent/omi/tree/master/packages/mappingjs) strong support
- Enhanced CSS, [rpx unit support](https://github.com/Tencent/omi/releases/tag/v4.0.26) base on **750** screen width
- Compliance with browser trend and API design
- Merge [**Web Components**](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/) and [**JSX**](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) into one framework
- Web Components can also be a data-driven view, **UI = fn(data)**.
- JSX is the best development experience (code intelligent completion and tip) UI Expression with least [grammatical noise](https://github.com/facebook/jsx#why-not-template-literals)and it's turing complete(template engine is not, es template string is but grammatical noise is too loud)
- Look at [Facebook React vs Web Components](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/225400/pros-and-cons-of-facebooks-react-vs-web-components-polymer)，Omi **combines their advantages** and gives developers the **freedom to choose the way they like**
- **Shadow DOM merges with Virtual DOM**, Omi uses both virtual DOM and real Shadow DOM to make view updates more accurate and faster
- **Scoped CSS**'s best solution is [**Shadow DOM**](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom), the community churning out frameworks and libraries for Scoped CSS (using JS or JSON writing styles such as Radium, jsxstyle, react-style; binding to webpack using generated unique `className``filename-classname-hash`, such as CSS Modules, Vue), are hack technologies; *and Shadow DOM Style is the perfect solution*.
